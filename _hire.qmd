## About

I am a machine learning engineer [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-khedekar-96b110202). I have worked with innovative companies and Products, which included. I am currently an independent consultant helping companies operationalize Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate their AI product journey.

You should consider hiring me if ...

-   Your LLMs need to be cheaper or faster.
-   You are overwhelmed by tools & frameworks.
-   Feel lost on what to prioritize and what experiments you should run.
-   Need outside expertise to evaluate your needs and vet potential talent.

-   LLM performance issues: (cost, quality, speed)
-   Custom Evaluation Systems
-   RAG, Fine-Tuning, and Prompt Engineering

I'll give you ongoing feedback and guidance via regular meetings with your team. This will help you avoid common pitfalls and select the right tools and techniques, saving you time and money.
